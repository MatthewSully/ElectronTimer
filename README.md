# Electron Timer App

This project is built on Electron and vanilla JavaScript. It is a handy time keeper application designed to keep running without pauses, allowing you to easily keep track of time sprints.

## Features

- **Continuous Timer**: The timer runs continuously without any pauses, ensuring accurate time tracking during your sprints.
- **Always On Top**: The timer window remains above all of your other applications as a countdown. The screen size is easily adjusted to not be in the way.
- **Simple and Intuitive**: The app provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy to start and dismiss the timer.
- **Customizable Settings**: You can customize the timer duration, and more settings are planned. Currently, the alarm is a startling honking sound. It really gets the adrenaline going when you're surprised by it.

## Planned Enhancements

We have several planned enhancements for the Electron Timer App, including:

- **New Features**: I am working on adding new features to improve the functionality and usability of the app.
- **Improvements**: I welcome feedback from anyone who stumbles upon this project.
- **Project Reorganization**: I plan on reorganizing the project structure to for better maintainability and scalability.
